# Skeleton Ruby Project
Skeleton project to quickly scaffold out the structure for a new Ruby project.

## Installation
Simple ```git clone``` the repo to  a new project directory and then update the references in the various files.

## Attribution
This project was inspired from the great article written here: https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex46.html.
I cannot take responsibility for this project. All I have done is simply push it to Github to make my own life easier when spinning up new projects.
